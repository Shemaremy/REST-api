# RESTful API Course Outline


1. Introduction to RESTful APIs
- What is an API?
- What is REST?
- Overview of Representational State Transfer
- Why use REST?



2. Basics
- HTTP Methods
- GET, POST, PUT, DELETE

3. Getting started with practice for beginners (create an express web server)
- npm init --y : Initialise your whole repo
- npm i express : Install the express framework
- npm i --save-dev nodemon : This one restarts the server for  each change made (optional)
    -> Instead of running our server using node index.js, we say: nodemon index.js
